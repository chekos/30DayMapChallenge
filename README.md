You can access the data e.g. from [GeoFabrik](https://www.geofabrik.de/data/download.html) or some of [these](https://learnosm.org/en/osm-data/getting-data/) sources.

[See some inspiration from the great monochrome mapping competition](https://somethingaboutmaps.wordpress.com/monocarto-2019-winners/) (although those masterpieces took a bit more than a day to make, probably). |
| 10      | `10-11-2021` | **Raster**                           | Nothing stops you from doing almost all of the maps with raster data. But this day is dedicated to those lovely pixels.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 11      | `11-11-2021` | **3D**                             | The magnificent third dimension! Visualize something in 3D                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 12      | `12-11-2021` | **Population** | That is you and me. Or maybe animal population from [Movebank.org](https://www.movebank.org/cms/movebank-main)? Anyhow a classic theme for thematic maps.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 13      | `13-11-2021` | **Data challenge 2: Natural Earth**                         | Great public domain map dataset for cartography on global and national scales. You can use Natural Earth as a part of your map or as the main source. You can download the data from a few different locations, but probably the easiest access is via [GitHub](https://github.com/nvkelso/natural-earth-vector/tree/master/geojson) or the [Natural Earth homepage](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/).                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 14      | `14-11-2021` | **Map with a new tool**                 | As the whole #30DayMapChallenge is much about learning and experimenting, this day is dedicated to exploring new tools. See the list on this repo below or find something interesting yourself!                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 15      | `15-11-2021` | **Map made without using a computer**                    | Title speaks for itself.

Different resolutions and areas you can choose from.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| 25      | `25-11-2021` | **Interactive map**                       | What if the user wants to click, pan and explore your map? If you don't feel comfortable with programming, one easy way is to use [qgis2web](https://github.com/tomchadwin/qgis2web) plugin. Or try out for example [kepler.gl](https://kepler.gl/) or [Unfolded Studio](https://studio.unfolded.ai/home).                                                                                                        |
| 26      | `26-11-2021` | **Choropleth map**            | A choropleth map is a type of thematic map in which a set of pre-defined areas is colored or patterned in proportion to a statistical variable that represents an aggregate summary of a geographic characteristic within each area, such as population density or per-capita income. (Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map))                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 27      | `27-11-2021` | **Heatmap**              |        A heat map (or heatmap) is a data visualization technique that shows magnitude of a phenomenon as color in two dimensions. The variation in color may be by hue or intensity, giving obvious visual cues to the reader about how the phenomenon is clustered or varies over space. (Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_map))                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

You can use e.g. [this QGIS plugin.](https://github.com/GispoCoding/GlobeBuilder)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Spend the day either by 1) collecting your entries from the challenge to a common gallery, 2) writing a tutorial or a blog post on one of your maps or 3) create a map from a theme you have chosen yourself                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
